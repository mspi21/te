# C Text Editor

A basic graphical text editor. The goal of this project is to explore how a text editor would be written from scratch using only the C programming language, the OpenGL API, and the SDL and FreeType libraries.

Eventually, it should be a minimalist, modern & slightly experimental text editor with modular syntax highlighting and language server capabilities, with further improvements specifically for C development (maybe C++).

## Dependencies

- glew (OpenGL)
- sdl2
- freetype2

## Build

Run `make` and then `make run`.
