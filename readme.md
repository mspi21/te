# C Text Editor

> Disclaimer: This software is a work in progress and contains several bugs. Use at your own risk.

A basic graphical text editor. The goal of this project is to explore how a text editor would be written from scratch using only the C programming language, the OpenGL API, and the SDL and FreeType libraries.

Eventually, it should be a minimalist, modern & slightly experimental text editor with modular syntax highlighting and language server capabilities, with further improvements specifically for C development (maybe C++).

## Licence

This software does not come with a licence (yet). You are free to view and fork the code as described in the [Github Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service). Should you wish to use or modify the software, please contact me via email, building and testing the program locally is allowed without explicit permission.

I will most likely add a proper licence with the first release.
