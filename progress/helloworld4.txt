Hello there!

While this program still doesn't yet feel like a code editor, it now definitily feels like at least a notepad! I implemented a couple of cool features which I can't easily demonstrate in text, so I'll at least describe them.
You can now click anywhere to move the cursor, arrow keys work as usual, ctrl+arrow keys either skips words (right, left) or swaps adjacent lines (up, down).
Also, when typing and moving the cursor, the editor automatically scrolls to keep the cursor in view, though this isn't perfect yet.

I feel like I could now use this pretty universally. In terms of features, it's now almost like nano, except, of course, it is graphical.
Next, I would like to work on copying and pasting selections, which is pretty much the only big thing I'm missing right now.

Pretty cool!
